# Clustering-Platform
The goal of this project is to make it easier for non-AI students to understand clustering algorithms.

We provide a simple yet complete implementation of some of the most commonly used clustering algorithms such as: 

* kmeans
* k-nearest neighbors
* hierarchical clustering
* DBSCAN
